Hii, I am Sarvesh.
I'm pursuing B.Tech in CSE from IIT Guwahati. I'm passionate about coding.

Opensource is a great platform to work on. 
While working on opensource, we are a part of the entire coding community.
We help the whole community grow while ensuring our own growth. 
That is why I want to contribute to opensource.
